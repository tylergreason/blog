      <article>
        <h1 id="hello-world">Hello, World</h1>

        <p><em>Monday, 2025-03-17</em></p>

        <p>
          I'm writing this post to get <em>something</em> out there. I've been
          inspired to blog for a few months but haven't taken the time to sit
          down and make one. There have been too many self imposed hurdles: I
          don't want to use a blogging service, I want to make my
          <em>own</em> blog, but that comes with a lot of work if I want
          features like searching for posts, tagged posts, an RSS feed, a nice
          design, etcetera. But those hurdles really are just that: self
          imposed. I don't <em>need</em> any of those features, and I can add
          them overtime if I want to. For now, it's okay just to have an HTML
          file with my thoughts on it, and maybe a bit of styling to make it
          nice to look at. Other features can wait - getting started is what is
          important.
        </p>
        <p>So why start a blog? Well, for me, the reasons are many:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            I'm not on social media and have no plans to be anytime in the
            future. If I want to connect with others, I need to put the effort
            into making myself heard. Thus, I can use my blog as a platform to
            do that.
          </li>
          <li>
            There are many things I want to write about and that I
            <em>do</em> write about, just not in a way that others can read. I
            want a reason to write in a way where I'm communicating with others,
            and blogging is kind of like writing in a way in which you're
            communicating with the whole world.
          </li>
          <li>
            I just want to start something. Something low stakes, where if I end
            up falling off after a single post, it's not a big deal.
          </li>
          <li>
            I've always wanted to start a blog. I read lots of other peoples'
            blogs, mostly on role playing games and war games. They're great,
            full of incredible creativity. And these people have a public
            history of the thoughts they've shared with the world, some going
            back more than a decade. That's a beautiful thing that I want to
            take a shot at.
          </li>
          <li>
            In a similar vein, I want to be able to look back on my writing
            years from now and read it to understand who I was at the time it
            was written. I keep a daily journal which will serve the same
            purpose, but a public blog will be something people can use to
            understand who I was as well.
          </li>
          <li>
            There are probably lots of other reasons. But I need to get this
            post up, so let's not get stuck in the details and instead move on!
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          With that out of the way, what will this blog be about? Well, probably
          not about what I'm about to say it'll be about, but I'm just saying
          that in case I read this down the line, when I have made a blog all
          about something random like early French film (something I know
          nothing about!) instead of what I said it'd be about.
        </p>
        <p>
          I want this blog to be about whatever I'm into at any given time.
          Right now I'm into:
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>Programming (my career)</li>
          <li>Role playing games</li>
          <li>Miniature skirmish games</li>
          <li>Fantasy and sci fi miniatures</li>
          <li>
            Drawing, and art tools (fountain pens and inks, pencils, nice paper)
          </li>
          <li>Travel</li>
          <li>Hiking</li>
          <li>Gardening</li>
          <li>Art in general (both making and appreciating art)</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          These interests come and go as the weeks pass. I'm rarely interested
          in anything for more than a few days at a time, so the idea of making
          a blog
          <em>just</em> about programming or <em>just</em> about fountain pens
          or <em>just</em> about early French film is too daunting. Having a
          space to write about whatever I want to write about suites me much
          better.
        </p>
        <p>
          So there you have it, my first blog post. Where will it go from here?
          Who knows! I have some ideas for posts. I've reviewed one of my
          fountain pens (the Pilot Penmanship, a great budget pen) and would
          love to share my thoughts on that. I also want to write about what I'm
          drawing, which is currently some miniature people I'm cutting out in
          hopes of making little dioramas with them. I've been wanting to sit
          down and make a scene for weeks now, so maybe sharing that intention
          with the world will help that come to fruition.
        </p>
        <p>
          If anyone reads this, I hope you stick around to see what else I blog
          about. Maybe you'll find it interesting? Maybe not? Maybe you're an AI
          scraping my content without my permission? Whatever the case, I hope
          you enjoy what you find.
